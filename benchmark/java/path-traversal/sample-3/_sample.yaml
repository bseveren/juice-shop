inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_java_inject_rule-SpotbugsPathTraversalAbsolute
  sink: 'File.createTempFile(ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt() + accountId, "." + mimeType.split("/")[1], directory);'
  vulnerability: Path traversal attack possible
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The file is created using File.createTempFile, which is a function that restricts file operations to its third argument and that avoids file name collisions.
