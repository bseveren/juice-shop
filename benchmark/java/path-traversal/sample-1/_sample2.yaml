inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_java_httpservlet-path-traversal
  sink: Files.deleteIfExists(Paths.get(uploadedFile.getAbsolutePath()));
  vulnerability: Path traversal attack possible
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The file that is deleted was created via TempFile.createTempFile, which is a function that restricts file operations to the system's tmp folder and that avoids file name collisions.
  source: 'File uploadedFile = TempFile.createTempFile(System.currentTimeMillis() + "-", fileName);'
  unittest: null
