  vulnerability: HTTP request might enable SSRF attack
outputs:
  priority: lowest
  reasoning: The host of the request is coming from a request sent to a domain of a well-known company, salesforce.com. This makes a potential SSRF vulnerability very difficult to expliot. The url contains a hard-coded suffix, hindering an attacker from choosing arbitrary paths. The response of the request is not returned to the user, this reduces the priority (blind SSRF).
