inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_java_tainted-ssrf
  sink: HttpsURLConnection con = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
  vulnerability: HTTP request might enable SSRF attack
outputs:
  priority: low
  reasoning: The host of the request is passed to the ShopifyOAuthManager constructor as the shop argument. Its origin is unclear however. The url contains a hard-coded suffix, hindering an attacker from choosing arbitrary paths. The response of the request is not returned to the user, this reduces the priority (blind SSRF).
  source: URL url = new URL(HTTPS + this.shop + OAUTH_VALIDATE_URL);
  unittest: null
