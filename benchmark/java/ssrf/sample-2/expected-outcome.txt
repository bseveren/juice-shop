SSRF ..
- sink = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
- downgrade: SHOPIFY_FOO_APP_STATUS_URL is uppercase, seems to indicate a 'constant'. The definition includes a call to default() -20
- downgrade: the definition of SHOPIFY_FOO_APP_STATUS_URL also includes an append of  + "/shopifyFooAppStatus"; so an attacker cannot pick the path -20
- downgrade: it's a PUT call and the result is not returned at all (blind SSRF): -10/-15
- SSRF starts at 89/100
- expected severity low to medium
- expected outcome: 30-40
