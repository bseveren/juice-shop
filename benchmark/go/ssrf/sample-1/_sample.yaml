  vulnerability: HTTP request might enable SSRF attack
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The base of the request url is set in providerURL, where it's fixed to 'https://sapi.acme.gr'. As the base url cannot be manipulated by an attacker, the snippet is safe from SSRF.
  source: "url := fmt.Sprintf(providerURL, config.Conf.Mstat.Auth, data.ID, url.QueryEscape(data.From), data.To, url.QueryEscape(data.Msg), coding)"
