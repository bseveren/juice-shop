  vulnerability: HTTP request might enable SSRF attack
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The base of the request url is sourced from a globally-scoped config object via config.GetConfig(). As it is unlikely that an attacker can manipulate the program's configuration, the snippet is considered safe from SSRF.
