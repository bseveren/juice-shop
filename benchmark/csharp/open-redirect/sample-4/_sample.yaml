inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_csharp_endpoint_rule_UnvalidatedRedirect
  sink: return Redirect(returnUrl);
  vulnerability: Open redirect can be used in social engineering attacks
outputs:
  priority: safe
  probability: unlikely
  severity: minor
  reasoning: The user is only redirected to returnUrl if the url is local (checked via Url.IsLocalUrl), so the redirect isn't vulnerable to open redirects.
  source: public ActionResult Auth(LogOnModel model, string returnUrl)
  unittest: null
