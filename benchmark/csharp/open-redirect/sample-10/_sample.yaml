inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_csharp_endpoint_rule_UnvalidatedRedirect
  sink: return Redirect($"/{itemType}/{itemId}");
  vulnerability: Open redirect can be used in social engineering attacks
outputs:
  priority: highest
  probability: certain
  severity: minor
  reasoning: itemType comes from the web request and the preceding forward slash doesn't fully protect against open redirects, e.g. the user may be redirected to the protocol-relative URL //example.com by setting itemType=/example.com The severity of the vulnerability is minor as it does not directly compromise sensitive data.
