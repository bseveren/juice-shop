inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_csharp_endpoint_rule_UnvalidatedRedirect
  sink: return Redirect(destinationUrl);
  vulnerability: Open redirect can be used in social engineering attacks
outputs:
  priority: safe
  probability: unlikely
  severity: minor
  reasoning: As baseUrl is a constant, this redirect isn't vulnerable to open redirects.
  source: var destinationUrl = string.Format("{0}?{1}", baseUrl, param.ToString("=", "&"));
