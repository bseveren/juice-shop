inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_csharp_endpoint_rule_UnvalidatedRedirect
  sink: return Redirect($"~/{itemType}/{itemId}");
  vulnerability: Open redirect can be used in social engineering attacks
outputs:
  priority: safe
  probability: zero
  severity: minor
  reasoning: The redirect url starts with a tilde which points to the root of the ASP.NET MVC Web application, so the redirect isn't vulnerable to open redirects.
