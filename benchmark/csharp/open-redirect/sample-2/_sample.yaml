inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_csharp_endpoint_rule_UnvalidatedRedirect
  sink: return Redirect(string.Format("/order/detail.aspx?orderId={0}&status=1{1}", orderId, queryStringAddition));
  vulnerability: Open redirect can be used in social engineering attacks
outputs:
  priority: safe
  probability: unlikely
  severity: minor
  reasoning: The start of the redirect url is hard-coded to /order/detail.aspx, so this redirect isn't vulnerable to open redirects.
