inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_py_LFI
  sink: Path.joinpath(Path(module.__path__[0]).parent, "pyproject.toml"), "rb"
  vulnerability: Potential file inclusion attack via reading file
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The argument to Path.joinpath resolves to the pyproject.toml meta file included in the python project. It is a static file location that cannot be influenced by user input. Therefor it is not susceptible to a file inclusion attack.
