  ruleId: AIK_python_B318
  sink: xml_dom = xml.dom.minidom.parseString(stripped_body)
  vulnerability: Using blacklisted XML parsing function is dangerous
outputs:
  priority: medium
  reasoning: It is plausible (but rather unlikely) that 'body' can represent unchecked user input, being injected in a function known to be vulnerable to XML attacks. Such an XML attack could make the server execute code, potentially manipulating sensitive data. Therefore, the severity is critical.
