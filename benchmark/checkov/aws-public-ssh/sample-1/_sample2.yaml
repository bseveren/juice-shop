  vulnerability: Firewall rules allow SSH from any public IP
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: While this ingress rule allows SSH access from public addresses, the access is restricted to just the four ip addresses listed in acme_ips. As these are likely trusted ip addresses, the identified vulnerability is safe to ignore.
