inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_ts_node_nosqli_injection
  sink: "const emailOnDb = await Emails.findOne({ email, verifiedAt: { $gt: oneMonthAgo } });"
  vulnerability: NoSQL injection attack possible
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The oneMonthAgo variable is not controlled by the user and the email variable is cast to a string prior to the findOne call. As the email parameter is guaranteed to be a string, the findOne call is not vulnerable to a nosql injection attack.
