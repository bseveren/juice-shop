    const idWork = req.body.idWork

    // Ensure idWork is provided
    if (!idWork) {

    const initialWork = await works.findOne({ id_work: idWork })
  vulnerability: NoSQL injection attack possible
  ruleId: node_nosqli_injection
outputs:
  priority: high
  reasoning: req.body.idWork comes is user-controlled (upgrade) and there is no sanitization (upgrade). The severity is limited to loading initialWork from other accounts, which limits the scope of the attack a bit (downgrade).
