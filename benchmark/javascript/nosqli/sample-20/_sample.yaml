outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: |
    There are two parameters in this query: name and shopId. While name is hardcoded, shopId is fetched from 'Reaction', an object that very likely comes from the Reaction e-commerce ecosystem => mark as safe because we consider this kind of APIs as trusted. This is likely client-side code.
