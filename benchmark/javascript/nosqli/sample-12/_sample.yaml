  vulnerability: NoSQL injection attack possible
outputs:
  priority: safe
  severity: critical
  probability: zero
  reasoning: As an attacker would be able to mark an arbitrary sale as paid, the vulnerability is considered critical. The IsString and IsObjectId decorators on SaleTransactionDto::transactionId ensure that transactionId cannot contain arbitrary objects. Narrowing the values of transactionId completely mitigates the nosql injection vulnerability.
