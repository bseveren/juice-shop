inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_node_sqli_injection
  sink: return pool.query(`${sql} WHERE id = $1`, [id]);
  vulnerability: Potential SQL injection via string-based query concatenation
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: A parameterized query is used in node-postgress, which mitigates the risk of a sql injection attack
  source: read(id)
