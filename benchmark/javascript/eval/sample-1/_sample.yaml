inputs:
  ruleId: eval_nodejs
  sink: setTimeout(() => reject(new Error(`Job timed out after ${timeout}ms`)), timeout),
  vulnerability: Remote Code Execution possible via eval()-type functions
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The first argument to setTimeout is a function, not a string. This remediates any Remote Code Execution vulnerability.
