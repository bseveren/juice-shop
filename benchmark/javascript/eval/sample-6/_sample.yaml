  vulnerability: Remote Code Execution possible via eval()-type functions
  ruleId: AIK_ts_eval_nodejs
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: This is likely a user-defined setInterval function, as the function signature doesn't match the standard one. The user-defined function probably calls the standard setInterval function in its implementation. As a numeric timeout and an arrow function are passed to the setInterval function, the setInterval call isn't vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.
