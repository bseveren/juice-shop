inputs:
  ruleId: eval_nodejs
  sink: setTimeout(() => res.end("Alive"), timeOutMs);
  vulnerability: Remote Code Execution possible via eval()-type functions
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The first argument of setTimeout is a function. The second argument of setTimeout isn't vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.
  source: const timeOutMs = parseInt(req.query.timeoutMs) || 1 * 1_000;
