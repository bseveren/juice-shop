  vulnerability: Remote Code Execution possible via eval()-type functions
  ruleId: AIK_ts_eval_nodejs
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The setTimeout() calls the this.reset(domain) function after the timeout. The 'domain' variable, which is potentially user-provided, cannot do any harm, since it is not executed as string but only as function. The reset function does not return anything.
