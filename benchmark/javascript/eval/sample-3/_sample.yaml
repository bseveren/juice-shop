inputs:
  ruleId: eval_nodejs
  sink: return eval(`${operand1} ${op} ${operand2}`);
  vulnerability: Remote Code Execution possible via eval()-type functions
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The operand1 and operand2 variables are numbers and the op variable is restricted to a whitelist. This sanitization remediates any Remote Code Execution vulnerability.
