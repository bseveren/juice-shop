inputs:
  ruleId: generic_path_traversal
  sink: fs.readFile(req.query.file, "utf8", function (err, data)
  vulnerability: Potential file inclusion attack via reading file
outputs:
  priority: highest
  reasoning: The user-controlled file query parameter is passed directly to fs.readFile. Without any input sanitization, the program is vulnerable to path traversal attacks.
  source: req.query.file
  unittest: null
