inputs:
  sink: const outDir = path.resolve(process.cwd(), opts.outDir);
  vulnerability: Potential file inclusion attack via file path construction
  ruleId: join_resolve_path_traversal
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning:  Path resolution uses command line arguments via commander library, so no user input. The outDir comes from a required program option that is processed through standard CLI parsing.
