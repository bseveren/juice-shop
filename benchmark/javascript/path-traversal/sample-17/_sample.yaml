inputs:
  sink: dest = path.join('app/libs', path.basename(obj.src));
  vulnerability: Potential file inclusion attack via file path construction
  ruleId: join_resolve_path_traversal
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: While path.basename() is used which prevents directory traversal, the obj.src is user-controllable input that could potentially contain malicious filenames. However, the destination path is hardcoded to 'app/libs' making it safe.
