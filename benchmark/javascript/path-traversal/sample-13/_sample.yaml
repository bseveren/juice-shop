inputs:
  sink: const filePath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../../files/docs' + req.url)
  vulnerability: Potential file inclusion attack via file path construction
  ruleId: join_resolve_path_traversal
outputs:
  # sample too small?
  priority: highest
  reasoning: Direct user input from req.url is concatenated into the file path without sanitization. The only requirement is that url contains the expected endpoint before the '?' character, but it can reach any path by adding it as a parameter, e.g. attack payload 'foo?stuff=stuff/../../../etc/passwd'.
