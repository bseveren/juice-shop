  vulnerability: Potential file inclusion attack via file path construction
  ruleId: join_resolve_path_traversal
outputs:
  priority: highest
  reasoning: The code directly joins user-controlled URL pathname behind a server-defined path. Since this feeds into fs.readFile for serving files over HTTP, an attacker could access arbitrary files outside the web root directory.
