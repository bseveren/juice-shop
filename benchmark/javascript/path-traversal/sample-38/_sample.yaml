  vulnerability: Potential file inclusion attack via file path construction
  ruleId: join_resolve_path_traversal
outputs:
  priority: medium
  reasoning:  The path construction concatenates multiple unsanitized config properties (database, table, partitions) into an S3 key with no validation shown in the code. Since config appears to be derived from bucket/key parameters that originate from S3 events, which could potentially be manipulated, and there's no visible sanitization of these values, this could allow accessing unintended paths.
