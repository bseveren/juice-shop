inputs:
  sink: const gzippedFilePath = path.join(outputPath, `${req.url}.gz`);
  vulnerability: Potential file inclusion attack via file path construction
  ruleId: join_resolve_path_traversal
outputs:
  priority: high
  reasoning: Direct use of req.url in path.join without sanitization before the file existence check. The extension enforcement (.gz) doesn't prevent traversal since an attacker could end their path with .gz.
