inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_js_shell_injection_child_process
  sink: const child = spawn(aCmd[0], aCmd.slice(1));
  vulnerability: Potential for OS command injection via child_process call
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: All the variables in aCmd are computed from string literals, so a user cannot inject commands.
