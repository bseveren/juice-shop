  vulnerability: Potential for OS command injection via child_process call
  ruleId: AIK_js_shell_injection_child_process
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: First the android/cordova/lib/emulator.js file is very likely to be part of a CLI tool, typical in mobile app development. Second, the install_target given in the run function must be valid, otherwise the following is triggered 'return Q.reject('Target \'' + install_target + '\' not found, unable to run project');'. In that case, the vulnerable line is not reached.
  source: var command = 'adb -s ' + target + ' install -r "' + apk + '"';
  unittest: null
