  reasoning: There are 5 different callers of the runCmd function. The first one relies on a process variable and a hardcoded base url. The other four calls depend on thisProject.projectFolder. The thisProject is found with the rushConfig.getProjectByName function, with the project name read from a package.json file. Since rush loads its configured projects from a rush.json configuration file, thisProject is considered safe.
