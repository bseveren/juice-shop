  sink: exec(removeWatermark, err => {
  vulnerability: Potential for OS command injection via child_process call
  ruleId: AIK_js_shell_injection_child_process
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The exec function contains an unsanitized dirPath that is provided by temp.mkdir to the callback function. dirPath is the name of the newly created temporary directory and therefor safe from to command injection.
