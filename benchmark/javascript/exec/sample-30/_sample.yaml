inputs:
  sink: execSync(`chmod +x ${destinationPath}`);
  vulnerability: Potential for OS command injection via child_process call
  ruleId: AIK_js_shell_injection_child_process
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: destinationPath is defined by destination and executable. Destination is a hardcoded path, so considered safe. Executable can be found in the barScanner, it is hardcoded 'bar'.
  source: const destinationPath = path.join(destination, executable);
