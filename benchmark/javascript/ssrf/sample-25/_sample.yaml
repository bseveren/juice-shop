  vulnerability: HTTP request might enable SSRF attack
  ruleId: AIK_js_ssrf
outputs:
  priority: high
  reasoning: partnerUri is sourced from the Records in the event object. As there is no validation of the partnerUri or the Record, there exists a risk for SSRF if the event can be controlled by a malicious user.
  source: const partnerUri = record.messageAttributes["uri"].stringValue;
