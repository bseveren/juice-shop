  vulnerability: HTTP request might enable SSRF attack
  ruleId: AIK_js_ssrf
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: |
    The request URL is generated by the function surveyFillOutAnswerTaskPath() which likely substitutes the user data into a URL template generated for the surverFillOutAnswer route. So the request URL is very likely whitelisted to predetermined and safe routes anyway. If other payloads could be set by third party users with bad intent, it would be limited by setting parameters only, which we consider safe.
