    res.redirect(params.get().appUrl + "/login.html" + clientId);
  vulnerability: Open redirect can be used in social engineering attacks
  ruleId: express_open_redirect
outputs:
  priority: lowest
  reasoning: Unsure where params originates from, however if we assume this is something set by the system, the base of the url is not under user control and there is no risk of open redirect. As we can not guarantee this, the risk is lowest.
