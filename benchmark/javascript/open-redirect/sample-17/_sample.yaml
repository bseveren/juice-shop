inputs:
  sink: res.redirect('https://' + req.hostname + req.url)
  vulnerability: Open redirect can be used in social engineering attacks
  ruleId: express_open_redirect
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: Tampered Host headers can only affect the attacker's own request, as network-level Host header modification is not straightforward. The HTTPS redirect further mitigates potential risks, limiting the impact of local header manipulation.
