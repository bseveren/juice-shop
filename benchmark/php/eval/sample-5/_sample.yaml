inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_eval-use
  sink: eval($code);
  vulnerability: Unsafe eval usage can lead to remote code execution.
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The code reads a template file and evaluates its content. As the templates are stored on local disk, its contents may be assumed to be safe. This mitigates the risk for remote code execution.
