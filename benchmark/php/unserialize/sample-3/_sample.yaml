inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_unserialize-use
  sink: $payment = unserialize($data);
  vulnerability: Using unserialize can lead to remote code execution
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The signature of $data is verified, so it is reasonable to assume that the content of $data may be trusted.
  source: $data = serialize($fields);
