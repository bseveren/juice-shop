  sink: $data = unserialize((urldecode($data)));
  vulnerability: Using unserialize can lead to remote code execution
outputs:
  priority: highest
  reasoning: The data to be unserialized is sourced from the user request without any sanitization. This enables the reconstruction of arbitrary PHP objects, which makes the snippet vulnerable to remote code execution.
