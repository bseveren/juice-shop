inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_unserialize-use
  sink: $this->iFlagData = unserialize($rawdata);
  vulnerability: Using unserialize can lead to remote code execution
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The data to be unserialized is read from a file on disk, which is assumed to be trustworthy.
  source: $rawdata = fread($fp,filesize($file));
