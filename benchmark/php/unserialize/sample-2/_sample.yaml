inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_unserialize-use
  sink: $this->{$key} = unserialize(serialize($val));
  vulnerability: Using unserialize can lead to remote code execution
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The expression creates a deep clone of $val, which doesn't lead to remote code execution.
  source: foreach ($this as $key => $val)
  unittest: null
