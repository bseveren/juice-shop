  vulnerability: Potential SQL injection via string-based query concatenation
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: $customer_id contains an integer as IVdefspv returns an intval function call, which mitigates the risk of a sql injection via string-based query concatenation
  source: $customer_id = IVdefspv(0, $_REQUEST, 'c');
