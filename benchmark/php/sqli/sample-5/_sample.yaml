  vulnerability: Potential SQL injection via string-based query concatenation
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The variable $point_id is sourced from the database, which is assumed to contain safe values. The variable $new_val is checked to be numeric. This mitigates the risk of a sql injection via string-based query concatenation.
