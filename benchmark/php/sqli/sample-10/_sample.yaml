  vulnerability: Potential SQL injection via string-based query concatenation
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: $cid is decoded from the 'c' URI query parameter via decodeDigs. This decode function casts string elements to integers and returns strings consisting of only digits (non-numeric string elements are cast to the digit zero). These digit-only strings cannot inject harmful payloads into the sql query and therefor the query is safe from sql injection.
  source: $cid  = decodeDigs($cid);
  unittest: null
