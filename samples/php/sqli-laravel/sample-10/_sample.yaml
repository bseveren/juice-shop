  vulnerability: Potential SQL injection via Laravel function
outputs:
  priority: highest
  reasoning: DB::raw inserts a raw expression into the sql query without sanitization. As $groupId contains user input from the request and this user input isn't sanitized, the query is vulnerable to sql injection.
  source: $groupId = $request->groupId;
