  vulnerability: Rendering unescaped input can lead to XSS attacks
outputs:
  priority: highest
  reasoning: The persontype variable comes from the web request and is sent to the web user without validation. Given this, the priority for addressing this vulnerability is highest, as it could be exploited to access sensitive data, including authentication tokens, leading to potential unauthorized access and data theft.
  source: $persontype = $_REQUEST['persontype'];
