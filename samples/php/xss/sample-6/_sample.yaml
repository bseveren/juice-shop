  vulnerability: Rendering unescaped input can lead to XSS attacks
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: While the quantity POST variable comes from the user request, the multiplication expression with $unitPrice only succeeds when quantity contains a numeric value. For non-numeric quantity values, php throws a TypeError and stops execution. As the expression only results in numeric outputs, it cannot output harmful XSS payloads.
