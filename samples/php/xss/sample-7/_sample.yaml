  vulnerability: Rendering unescaped input can lead to XSS attacks
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: While the current_page variable comes from the user request, the subtraction expression only succeeds when $current_page contains a number. For non-numeric current_page values, php throws a TypeError and stops execution. As the subtraction expression only results in numeric outputs, it cannot output harmful XSS payloads.
