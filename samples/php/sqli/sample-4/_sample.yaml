  vulnerability: Potential SQL injection via string-based query concatenation
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The variables $fn and $ln are sanitized by the Sql_Escape function. While the implementation of Sql_Escape is unknown, we assume it returns safe values. This mitigates the risk of a sql injection via string-based query concatenation
  source: $fn = Sql_Escape($fn); $ln = Sql_Escape($ln);
