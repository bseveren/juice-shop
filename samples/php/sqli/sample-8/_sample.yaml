  vulnerability: Potential SQL injection via string-based query concatenation
outputs:
  priority: highest
  reasoning: The variables $f_id and $k aren't sanitized and are concatenated directly to the query string. Both variables are sourced from user values. The concatenation of these user values makes the query vulnerable to sql injection attacks.
  source: $f_id     = $_POST['frm_id']; foreach ($_POST as $k => $v)
  unittest: null
