  vulnerability: Potential SQL injection via string-based query concatenation
outputs:
  priority: highest
  reasoning: The variable $note_id contains $_POST['note_id'] which comes from the user request and isn't sanitized. It is included in the query string. The $note_id variable makes the query vulnerable to sql injection attacks.
  source: $note_id = $_POST['note_id']
