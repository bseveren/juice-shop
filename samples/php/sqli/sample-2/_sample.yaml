  vulnerability: Potential SQL injection via string-based query concatenation
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: $criteria contains date function results that produce safe output, which mitigates the risk of a sql injection via string-based query concatenation
  source: $criteria      .= " AND start_date BETWEEN $sDateSql AND $eDateSql";
  unittest: null
