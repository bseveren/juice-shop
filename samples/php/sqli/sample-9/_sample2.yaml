  vulnerability: Potential SQL injection via string-based query concatenation
outputs:
  priority: highest
  reasoning: The variable $personTypesInSql contains $_REQUEST['persontype'] (via $persontype) which comes from the user request and isn't sanitized. It is included in the sql query string. The $personTypesInSql variable makes the query vulnerable to sql injection attacks.
  source: $personTypesInSql = "'$persontype'";
