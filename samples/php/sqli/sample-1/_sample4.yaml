  vulnerability: Potential SQL injection via string-based query concatenation
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: $id is cast to an integer and $key is checked against a whitelist. This mitigates any risk of a sql injection via string-based query concatenation
  source: "$id   = intval($_POST['caregiver_id']); if ($key === 'VFLAG_DoNotBill' || $key === 'VFLAG_DoNotPay')"
