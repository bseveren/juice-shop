  vulnerability: Potential SQL injection via string-based query concatenation
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: $id is cast to an integer and $field is escaped and checked against a whitelist of removable fields, which mitigates the risk of a sql injection via string-based query concatenation
  source: "$id   = intval($_POST['caregiver_id']);"
