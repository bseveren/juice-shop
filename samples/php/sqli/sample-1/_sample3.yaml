  vulnerability: Potential SQL injection via string-based query concatenation
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: $c comes from PersonDataRow, which is fetched from a database. The row's id property is safe as it is an integer (which is evident from the type of $id), which mitigates the risk of a sql injection via string-based query concatenation
  source: "$c = PersonDataRow(PERSONTYPE_Caregiver, $id);"
  unittest: null
