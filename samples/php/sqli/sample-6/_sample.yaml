  vulnerability: Potential SQL injection via string-based query concatenation
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: While the $id variable is sourced from the user request, it is sanitized by preg_replace which ensures that only numeric characters are kept from the $_GET['id']. This sanitization mitigates the risk of a sql injection via string-based query concatenation.
  source: $id = preg_replace('/\D/', '', _ei($_GET['id']));
