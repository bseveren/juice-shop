inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_eval-use
  sink: "@$result = eval('return (float) ' . $equation . ';');"
  vulnerability: Unsafe eval usage can lead to remote code execution.
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: $equation is sanitized using a series of replacements and checked against a regex which only allows simple mathematical functions and operators. This mitigates the risk for arbitrary code execution.
