inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_eval-use
  sink: eval(file_get_contents($this->_langFile));
  vulnerability: Unsafe eval usage can lead to remote code execution.
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: A file is read from disk and its contents are evaluated as php code. As the file's location is hard-coded as a class member, it is safe to assume the contents of this file can be trusted. This mitigates the risk for remote code execution.
