inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_exec-use
  sink: exec('cpulimit -P ' . $processPath . ' -l ' . $maxCpuPercent . ' > /dev/null 2>&1 &');
  vulnerability: Unsafe exec usage can lead to remote code execution
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: $processPath is sanitized via whitelisting in the which function and $maxCpuPercent is sanitized via intval.
  source: "$maxCpuPercent = isset($_GET['maxCpuPercent']) ? intval($_GET['maxCpuPercent']) : 40;"
