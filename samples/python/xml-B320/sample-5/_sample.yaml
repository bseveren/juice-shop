  vulnerability: Using blacklisted XML parsing function is dangerous
  ruleId: AIK_python_B320
  packages:
    python:
      - package: lxml
        version: 4.9.2
outputs:
  priority: high
  reasoning: |
   lxml version is vulnerable, update was introduced in 5.0. This is vulnerable to XXE attacks. The input for this function seems to come from a database.
   Most likely a user can't use this function. Marking it as high because we can't garantue how the data is stored in the db and where it comes from. Another
   reason is that this application handles sensitive data.
