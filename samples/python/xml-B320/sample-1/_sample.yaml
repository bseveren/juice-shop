  vulnerability: Using blacklisted XML parsing function is dangerous

  priority: safe
  reasoning: |
    This code is safe since it's using the `defusedxml` package. By using the `forbid_dtd=True`,`forbid_entities=True` and `forbid_external=True` attacks like XXE. 
    Even if the provided_xml comes is from user input, there is no way to define a <!DOCTYPE> or <!ENTITY>.
