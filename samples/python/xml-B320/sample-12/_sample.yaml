  vulnerability: Using blacklisted XML parsing function is dangerous

  priority: medium
  reasoning: |
    We don't know the current version of lxml, we assume it's vulnerable. The lambda function is triggered by events in the S3 bucket (example: new object is 
    uploaded). The object that is passed in vulnerable function comes from the S3 bucket. We don't know who can upload objects, if it's user controlled 
    or not. The only reason why it isn't high is because it looks like an application that uploads content (tv shows) which are most likely propriatary.
