  vulnerability: Using blacklisted XML parsing function is dangerous
  ruleId: AIK_python_B320

  priority: low
  reasoning: |
     We don't know the version of lxml, we assume it is vulnerable. The xmls are fetched from a static url (the only parameters are date and until).
     We can't say how/by who they are uploaded, but based on the filename "hr_import_holidays" probably they are internal xmls.
