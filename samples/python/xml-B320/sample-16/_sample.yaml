  vulnerability: Using blacklisted XML parsing function is dangerous
  ruleId: AIK_python_B320
  packages: {}
outputs:
  priority: low
  reasoning: |
    We don't know the lxml version, so it may be vulnerable to XXE. The input is partially user-controlled without sanitization. 
    Since it's based on a SAML template, exploitation is harder but still possible.
