  vulnerability: Using blacklisted XML parsing function is dangerous

    We don't know the version of lxml, we can assume it's vulnerable. By reading the odoo documentation, the definition of result["arch"] is the following:
    `The power of Odoo views is that they declare how a particular screen should work, with a xml document (usually named arch, short for architecture). 
    This description can be extended/modified by xpaths serverside. Then the browser will load that document, parse it 
    (fancy word to say that it will extract the useful information), then represent the data accordingly.` 
    (https://github.com/ged-odoo/odoo-js-training-public/blob/master/notes_views.md, https://medium.com/@gourabofficial26/odoo-view-tutorial-c49c3b4da088).

    Generally views could probably be changed by the developers of the platform (safe) and maybe users that have access are admin(semi-trusted?). 
    I consider this low since it most likely is used in a trusted environment.
