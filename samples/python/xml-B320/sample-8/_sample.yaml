  vulnerability: Using blacklisted XML parsing function is dangerous

   lxml version is vulnerable, update was introduced in 5.0. This is vulnerable to XXE attacks. We can't tell where the input comes from and how the xmls are 
   uploaded. But from the comment "Factory to create specification by loading details from a fact XMl file" hints that maybe it can have an endpoint where a user
   can upload an xml. At the same time files are saved locally. It looks like an internal tool.
