  vulnerability: Using blacklisted XML parsing function is dangerous

  priority: low

    We don't know if it's a vulnerable version or not, so we assume it is. We don't know how the xml file is created, but it seems like it's created with data
    of employees. The data is fetched from a db. We also don't know exactly how it's retrieved, the api isn't defined. The code also doesn't look like it runs 
    in a production environment.
