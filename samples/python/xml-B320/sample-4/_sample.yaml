  vulnerability: Using blacklisted XML parsing function is dangerous
  ruleId: AIK_python_B320
  packages:
    python:
      - package: lxml
        version: 4.9.1
outputs:
  priority: high
  reasoning: |
    lxml version is vulnerable, update was introduced in 5.0. This is vulnerable to XXE attacks. The arguments passed to the function could possibly be 
    user controlled in this call: `response = client.service.LMEInfSeccC(request_data); xml_response = save_xml_to_file(response,'response')`. Since we don't know
    how to client responds, it could perform an xxe attack.
