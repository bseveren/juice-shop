  vulnerability: Using blacklisted XML parsing function is dangerous
  ruleId: AIK_python_B320
  packages:
    python:
      - package: lxml
        version: 4.6.2
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: | 
     lxml version is vulnerable, but the parser has the parameter`resolve_entities=False`. Since it has the parameter set it isn't vulnerable to xxe attacks or billion 
     laugh attack. This also doesn't look like production code.
