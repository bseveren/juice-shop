  vulnerability: Using blacklisted XML parsing function is dangerous
  ruleId: AIK_python_B320
  packages:
    python:
      - package: lxml
        version: 5.3.0
outputs:
  priority: high
  reasoning: |
    Even if it uses the updated `lxml` library, function receives as a parser that has resolve_entities=True. This means it can load external entities. 
    Since we can't see where the code is used and where the input comes from it isn't highest.
