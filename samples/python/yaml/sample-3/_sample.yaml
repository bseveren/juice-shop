  vulnerability: Unsafe yaml load can lead to remote code execution
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: "The CfnYamlLoader class inherits from yaml.SafeLoader and the tag constructor doesn't construct arbitrary python objects: only scalars, sequences and mappings are allowed and these are all loaded via SafeLoader. This mitigates remote code execution."
