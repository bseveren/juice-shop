inputs:
  ruleId: CKV_DOCKER_7
  sink: FROM base AS final
  vulnerability: Automatic upgrades of base Docker images can lead to supply chain attacks
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: This FROM statement is from a multi-stage Dockerfile where base refers to an earlier stage in the Dockerfile. The image of the base stage is pinned to a specific digest, which guarantees supply chain integrity of the base image.
