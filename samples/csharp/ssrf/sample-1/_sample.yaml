inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_csharp_SSRF
  sink: var responseMessage = await _httpClient.GetAsync($"{Resource}/children?Year={yearMonth.Year}&Month={yearMonth.Month}");
  vulnerability: HTTP request might enable SSRF attack
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The host of the request is a url that is defined as a class variable, which is assumed to be safe. The response of the request is not returned to the user, this reduces the priority (blind SSRF).
