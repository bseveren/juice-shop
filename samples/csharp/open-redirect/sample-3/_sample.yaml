inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_csharp_endpoint_rule_UnvalidatedRedirect
  sink: return Redirect(searchResultUrl);
  vulnerability: Open redirect can be used in social engineering attacks
outputs:
  priority: safe
  probability: zero
  severity: minor
  reasoning: The url is constructed using url.Action which resolves the url to a route known by .NET MVC, so the redirect isn't vulnerable to open redirects.
  source: string searchResultUrl = url.Action("SearchAction", "ProductSearch", new { query = query });
