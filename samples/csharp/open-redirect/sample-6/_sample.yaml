  vulnerability: Open redirect can be used in social engineering attacks
outputs:
  priority: lowest
  probability: zero
  severity: minor
  reasoning: The url of the zendesk API isn't under control of the user, so the redirect isn't vulnerable to open redirects. However, if the ZendeskApi Url method is vulnerable this could lead to an open redirect, as it is used as a base address without additional validation. As such the priority is lowest.
