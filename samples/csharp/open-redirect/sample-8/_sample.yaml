inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_csharp_endpoint_rule_UnvalidatedRedirect
  sink: "? Redirect(returnUrl)"
  vulnerability: Open redirect can be used in social engineering attacks
outputs:
  priority: highest
  probability: certain
  severity: minor
  reasoning: The controller redirects to returnUrl, which comes from the user request. It is only checked whether the string contains whitespaces or is null, but it is not sanitized or validated. This makes the redirect vulnerable to open redirects.
