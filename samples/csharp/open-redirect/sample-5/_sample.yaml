inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_csharp_endpoint_rule_UnvalidatedRedirect
  sink: return LocalRedirect(redirect);
  vulnerability: Open redirect can be used in social engineering attacks
outputs:
  priority: safe
  probability: unlikely
  severity: minor
  reasoning: The user is redirected to returnUrl via LocalRedirect which throws an exception if the url isn't local, so the redirect isn't vulnerable to open redirects.
  source: public ActionResult Auth(LogOnModel model, string returnUrl)
