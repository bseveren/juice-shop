  sink: const response = await axios.get(artifactUrl, { headers });
  vulnerability: HTTP request might enable SSRF attack
  ruleId: AIK_js_ssrf
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: "artifactUrl is sourced from the database (via getArtifactUrlFromDb), indexed with runId. As artifacts stored in the database are assumed to be safe, this mitigates the risk of SSRF."
  source: "const artifactUrl = await getArtifactUrlFromDb(runId)"
  unittest: null
