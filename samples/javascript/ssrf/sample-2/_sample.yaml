  vulnerability: HTTP request might enable SSRF attack
  ruleId: AIK_js_ssrf
outputs:

  reasoning: "Url is not under user control. It is sourced from configuration object, which is assumed to be safe. This mitigates the risk of SSRF."
  source: "const url = relayConfig.authApiUrl + '/auth/reset/confirm"
