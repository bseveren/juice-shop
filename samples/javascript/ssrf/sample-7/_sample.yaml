  vulnerability: HTTP request might enable SSRF attack
  ruleId: AIK_js_ssrf
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: "Base of url is not under user control. Auth0 appears to be a global variable as it is not passed to this function, so auth0 is likely to be set internally. This mitigates the risk of SSRF."
