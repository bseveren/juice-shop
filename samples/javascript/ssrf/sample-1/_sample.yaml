  vulnerability: HTTP request might enable SSRF attack
  ruleId: AIK_js_ssrf
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: It is unlikely that a user controls the contents of oauthStateToken, as oauthStateToken is likely under control of the server application. tokenURL comes from an object fetched from the database, which we consider to be a trusted source. The naming 'validatedAction' confirms that tokenUrl is likely validated already. Furthermore, it also concerns a blind SSRF, making it more complex to exploit the vulnerability without having access to the source code.
