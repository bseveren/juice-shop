  vulnerability: HTTP request might enable SSRF attack
  ruleId: AIK_js_ssrf
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: Appears to be client-side code. Indications are usage of flux and React.useState for state management. This limits the vulnerability to CSRF. Also, the url is constructed by a routing function based on an ID, which likely returns a whitelisted domain and route and only uses the ID to either choose from the whitelist or to set the ID parameter, both are considered safe.
