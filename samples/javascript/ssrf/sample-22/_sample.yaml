  vulnerability: HTTP request might enable SSRF attack
  ruleId: AIK_js_ssrf
outputs:
  priority: low
  reasoning: "Risk of SSRF depends on who initializes the AcmeAdapter class. More precisely: whether the domain parameter in the initialization is controlled by user input or not. The variable 'domain' is of type 'URL' which gives a hint that domain was likely validated or retrieved from server data before this class was created, but more context is required to determine risk of SSRF"
