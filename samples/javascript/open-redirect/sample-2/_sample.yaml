inputs:
  sink: ctx.redirect(entityIndexPageUrl(ctx.route.fullPath))
  vulnerability: Open redirect can be used in social engineering attacks
  ruleId: AIK_ts_express_open_redirect
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: |
    If someone includes a totally different path in ctx.route.fullPath, it won't work because it will never reach this endpoint.
    If someone includes the following payload in ctx.route.fullPath: expected/route/endpoint?param1=evilparameter&param2=canbeignored/
    as payload, it can still reach the endpoint, and the redirect will include the parameters because of the added slash. However, we only consider open-redirects dangerous when the endpoint can be changed, so mark as safe.
