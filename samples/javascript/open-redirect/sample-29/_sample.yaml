inputs:
  sink: res.redirect(301, url.toLowerCase());
  vulnerability: Open redirect can be used in social engineering attacks
  ruleId: express_open_redirect
outputs:
  priority: medium
  reasoning: Unclear where url originates from or whether it is controlled by a user. No sanitization or validation is applied to it though. It is checked whether it contains a query string though, although this doesn't mitigate any malicious url being used (we also don't know what this function does exactly).
