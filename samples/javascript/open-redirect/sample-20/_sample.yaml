  vulnerability: Open redirect can be used in social engineering attacks
  ruleId: express_open_redirect
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: Redirect to a relative URL, as such no risk of open redirect. If req.locale could be set to manipulated, there'd be risk of open redirect. However, req.locale is typically restricted by middleware using an allowlist based on Accept-Language headers.
