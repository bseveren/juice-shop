inputs:
  sink: res.redirect(join(req.path, 'index.html'));
  vulnerability: Open redirect can be used in social engineering attacks
  ruleId: express_open_redirect
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: path.join normalizes req.path to a safe, relative path, preventing open redirect attacks. Replacing path.join with string concatenation introduces risk, as it allows req.path to manipulate the redirect target (e.g., //example.org/ redirects to an external domain).
