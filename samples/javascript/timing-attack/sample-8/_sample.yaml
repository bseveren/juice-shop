  vulnerability: A timing attack might allow hackers to bruteforce passwords
  ruleId: AIK_ts_node_timing_attack
outputs:
  priority: high
  reasoning: byte by byte comparison of a token used to validate an email address during user registration. Even though the controller immediately returns when the comparison fails, the priority is downgraded once because a user object is queried from the database which introduces some jitter to the response times.
