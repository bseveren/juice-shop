  reasoning: The executeCommand is called once by the loadImageIfAvailable function. This defines a command that depends on the function argument 'tarFilPath'. The loadImageIfAvailable is called 7 times. In each of these cases, it depends on 'tempPath' and a hardcoded suffix. The tempPath is defined by this.ipcRendererService.getTempDir(); which is considered shielded from user input.
  source: this.executeCommand('docker image load -i ' + tarFilePath))
