  vulnerability: Potential for OS command injection via child_process call
  ruleId: AIK_js_shell_injection_child_process
outputs:
  priority: medium
  reasoning: This function is vulnerable since there is no sanitization or whitelisting of the commandName. However, it is unclear from where this function is called.
  source: return commandExistsUnixSync(commandName);
