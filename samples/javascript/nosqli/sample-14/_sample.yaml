  vulnerability: NoSQL injection attack possible
outputs:
  priority: highest
  # Potential to have priority 'very high'.
  reasoning: This 'model.findOne()' and '.lean()' is typical Mongoose syntax. While the default configuration of Mongoose enforces that the _id field is a valid ObjectId; it remains possible to pass filter objects to findOne as long as the filter value for _id is a valid ObjectId. As request.params.id might contain arbitrary objects; this snippet is vulnerable to NoSQL injection.
  source: const id = request.params.id;
