inputs:
  ruleId: generic_path_traversal
  sink: fs.readFile(file, "utf8", function (err, data)
  vulnerability: Potential file inclusion attack via reading file
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: |
    path.normalize("." + path.sep + "../../etc/passwd") keeps the path traversal patterns '../' and '..\' in the normalized path. Together with the up path regex, the snippet is effective at preventing path traversal vulnerabilities.
