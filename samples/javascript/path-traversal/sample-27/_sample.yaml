  vulnerability: Potential file inclusion attack via file path construction
  ruleId: join_resolve_path_traversal
outputs:
  priority: low
  reasoning: |
    Downgrade once because workItem likely comes from a queuing system, not from user input. Downgrade because the attack is limited to .pdf files. Upgrade because no other sanitization is present. E.g. workItem.id could be defined as a string and escape the context by inserting e.g. "../../../../some-file".
