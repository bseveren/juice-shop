  vulnerability: Potential file inclusion attack via file path construction
  ruleId: AIK_ts_join_resolve_path_traversal
outputs:
  priority: highest
  reasoning: The code directly joins user-controlled URL pathname with static_files_root without any path sanitization. Since path.join resolves '../' sequences, an attacker could craft a URL with path traversal to read files outside the static directory. The file contents are then sent to the client in binary mode, enabling sensitive file disclosure.
