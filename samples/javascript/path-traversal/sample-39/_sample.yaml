  vulnerability: Potential file inclusion attack via file path construction
  ruleId: join_resolve_path_traversal
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The resourceType input is validated against a predefined 'resources' array before use (via resources.includes(args[0])), and the path construction only involves lowercase transformation and hyphenation of this validated input. The destination path is also within a controlled directory.
