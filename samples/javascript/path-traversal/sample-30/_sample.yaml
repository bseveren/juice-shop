inputs:
  sink: return path.join(compilation.getPath(compilation.compiler.outputPath), name.split('?')[0]);
  vulnerability: Potential file inclusion attack via file path construction
  ruleId: join_resolve_path_traversal
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The path is constructed using compilation.getPath() which is internal to webpack's compilation process, and name.split('?')[0] safely handles query parameters. The function is part of a webpack plugin (BundleTrackerPlugin) that operates on compiled assets rather than user input, making this a safe internal path construction.
