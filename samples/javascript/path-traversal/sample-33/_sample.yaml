inputs:
  sink: const sDestinationDir = `${path.resolve(oPath.destination, '..')}/`;
  vulnerability: Potential file inclusion attack via file path construction
  ruleId: join_resolve_path_traversal
outputs:
  priority: medium
  reasoning: The code resolves a path with '..' parent directory reference from oPath.destination, which is directly constructed from user-controlled S3 paths (sRemotePath parameter). Upgrade because no sanitization. Downgrade because the data sLocalDir and sPath look like they come from trusted source, either server logic or S3 libraries.
