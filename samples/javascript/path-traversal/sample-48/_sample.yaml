inputs:
  sink: const resolvedPath = path.resolve(`${__dirname}/dist${decodeURI(req.url)}`);
  vulnerability: Potential file inclusion attack via file path construction
  ruleId: join_resolve_path_traversal
outputs:
  priority: highest 
  reasoning: Direct path traversal vulnerability exists as req.url is decoded and concatenated into the file path without proper sanitization. A payload like 'index?stuff=otherstuff/../../file' would escape the context.
