  vulnerability: Potential file inclusion attack via reading file
  ruleId: generic_path_traversal
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: While multer's req.file.path points to a temporary file created by multer which is typically safe, it could potentially be dangerous if multer isn't properly configured with storage limits and file type restrictions. However, in this code we see the file is immediately processed and deleted, plus there's a host check (req.get('host') != process.env.XSS_HOSTNAME) that happens earlier in the route, reducing the risk.
