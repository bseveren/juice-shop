inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_ts_generic_path_traversal
  sink: fs.readFileSync(filePath, "utf-8")
  vulnerability: Potential file inclusion attack via reading file
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: An error is thrown if the filePath contains path traversal patterns, which limits file access to the sessions folder thereby mitigating a file inclusion attack.
  source: const filePath = `./sessions/${sessionId}.json`;
