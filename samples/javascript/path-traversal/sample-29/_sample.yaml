  vulnerability: Potential file inclusion attack via reading file
  ruleId: generic_path_traversal
outputs:
  priority: high
  reasoning: The code takes an unsanitized path parameter (route) and directly uses it in file operations within the data directory. Despite using __dirname, path traversal is possible since there's no path sanitization before concatenating with the base path. The attack is limited to .json files.
  source: const route = request.params[0];
