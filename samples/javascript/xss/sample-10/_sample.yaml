  vulnerability: Using document write methods can lead to XSS attacks
  ruleId: AIK_js_insecure-document-method
outputs:
  priority: high
  reasoning: This code highlights search terms in the rows of a datatable. If aData[j] contains harmful HTML elements, then updating the innerHTML of the table cell would render these tags in the user's browser. As the component containing the code snippet is a datatable, it might display data that was created by other users. This would be an example of a stored XSS attack.
