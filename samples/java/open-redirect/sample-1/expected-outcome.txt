open redirect.
- sink = response.sendRedirect(redirectUrl);
- the source is incomingURI = request.getRequestURI(), so the host is basically the one where it's hosted. That makes this basically a false positive, can't be used in social engineering by changing the host etc
- open redirects starts at 70/100
- expected outcome: 0-10
