inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_java_inject_rule-SpotbugsPathTraversalAbsolute
  sink: File file1 = new File(file, fileName);
  vulnerability: Path traversal attack possible
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The statement creates a new file under file; which is not susceptible to path traversal attacks. The fileName argument is equal to the literal 'cache.json'. So a path traversal attack is not possible.
  source: mFileUtils.writeJsonToFile(getCachedDirName(), 'cache.json'), featureFlagRespObj);
