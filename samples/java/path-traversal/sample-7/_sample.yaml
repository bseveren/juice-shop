inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_java_httpservlet-path-traversal
  sink: File file = new File("log/", fileName);
  vulnerability: Path traversal attack possible
outputs:
  priority: highest
  reasoning: The File constructor allows traversing the file system outside of the parent directory. As the fileName request parameter isn't sanitized, this makes the program vulnerable to file traversal attacks.
  source: String fileName = req.getParameter("fileName");
  unittest: null
