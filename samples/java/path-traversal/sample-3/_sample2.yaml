  ruleId: AIK_java_inject_rule-SpotbugsPathTraversalAbsolute
  sink: Files.deleteIfExists(Paths.get(tempFilePair.getKey().getAbsolutePath()));
  vulnerability: Path traversal attack possible
outputs:
  priority: safe
  reasoning: The deleted file was created by File.createTempFile, which is a function that restricts file operations to its third argument and that avoids file name collisions. This prohibits deleting arbitrary files.
  source: 'File tempFile = File.createTempFile(ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt() + accountId, "." + mimeType.split("/")[1], directory);'
