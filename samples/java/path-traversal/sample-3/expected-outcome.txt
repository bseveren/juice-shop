path trav
- 2x sink =Files.deleteIfExists  +  new FileBody(t
- file is creating using user input, but via a safe function that does checks against path traversal (TempFile.createTempFile)
- SSRF starts at 85/100
- note: context from the 'calling file' is missing, but it's not even NEEDED to know it is safe!
- expected outcome: 0-10
