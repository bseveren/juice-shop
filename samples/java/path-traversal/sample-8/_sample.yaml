inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_java_httpservlet-path-traversal
  sink: File imageFile = new File(albumFolder, fileName);
  vulnerability: Path traversal attack possible
outputs:
  priority: highest
  reasoning: The File constructor allows traversing the file system outside of the parent directory. As the fileName from data parameter isn't sanitized, this makes the program vulnerable to file traversal attacks.
  source: String fileName = formItems.get(1).getString();
