SSRF
- sink =  new URL(certificateUrl).openStream
- source = data coming from a request indeed
- SSRF starts at 89/100
- this is an SSRF  for sure, but these are protected/private functions, and the result of getCertificateContents
 is used to generate a certificate, which is then only used to validate a message. So still a blind SSRF
- note: there are functions included that are not used in the 'chain'. Let's see if it can deal with it..
- expected outcome: 30-40
