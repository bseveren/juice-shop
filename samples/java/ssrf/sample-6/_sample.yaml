inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_java_tainted-ssrf
  sink: Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new URL(certificateUrl).openStream())
  vulnerability: HTTP request might enable SSRF attack
outputs:
  priority: lowest
  reasoning: While the origin of certificateUrl is a network request, the url is validated by checking the protocol and host components. As sns.amazonaws.com belongs to a trustworthy company, the certificateUrl is expected to be safe and the risk on SSRF is small.
