inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_java_tainted-ssrf
  sink: HttpsURLConnection con = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
  vulnerability: HTTP request might enable SSRF attack
outputs:
  priority: lowest
  reasoning: The host of the request appears to be a constant, as it is a static final class member. Therefore the host is hard to manipulate by an attacker. The url contains a hard-coded suffix, hindering an attacker from choosing arbitrary paths. The response of the request is not returned to the user, this reduces the priority (blind SSRF).
