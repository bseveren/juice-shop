SSRF is really exploitable here.
- sink = new httpGet(), new httpPost(),..
- upgrade expected because data indeed flows from the request to the sink (bad)
- small downgrade: attempts are made to validate, but still vulneralbe to TOCTOU bypass (positive, but does not clear the issue for auto-ignoring!)
- upgrade again: testContentAPI function actually sends the response back to the output, showing attack the output of the SSRF (bad)
- SSRF starts at 89/100
- expected outcome: 95-100
