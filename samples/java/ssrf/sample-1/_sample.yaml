inputs:
  ruleId: AIK_java_tainted-ssrf
  sink: HttpsURLConnection con = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
  vulnerability: HTTP request might enable SSRF attack
outputs:
  priority: low
  reasoning: The host of the request is a shop url that is fetched from a database, which is assumed to be sanitized. The response of the request is not returned to the user, this reduces the priority (blind SSRF).
